app for solving bvp
Explore the capabilities of MATLAB’s built-in solvers, specifically bvp4c and bvp5c, which are designed
for solving two-point boundary value problems (BVPs).
• Refer to the Matlab help to investigate the functionality and applications of bvp4c and bvp5c.
Understand how these solvers are designed for BVPs, focusing on their key features and potential
use cases.
• Using the Matlab GUI tool (appdesigner), write a Matlab tool to run the examples reported
in Shampine, L.F., M.W. Reichelt, and J. Kierzenka. ”Solving Boundary Value Problems for
Ordinary Differential Equations in MATLAB with bvp4c.” MATLAB File Exchange, 2004. Apply
the bvp4c and bvp5c solvers and document how these solvers are utilized in solving the given
problems.
